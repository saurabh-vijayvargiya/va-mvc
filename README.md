# VA-MVC
This is a MVC framework in php that I am building to refresh my php knowledge. If luckily you find this framework worth using then you will need to follow the below steps -

 - Duplicate `.env_example` and rename it to `.env`. Then just update the db details and the site name that you would like to call your site.
 - When you create a controller, create it in `app/controllers` folder. In the new controller you will need to extend `Controller`. This base controller can be found in the `app/libraries`.
 - You will be creating the models in the `app/models` folder.
 - You can create the views in the `app/views` folder.
 - If you need to create and helper for the framework, then create it in the `app/helpers` folder.
